# Homelatro
A Balatro mod that adds several Homestuck-related items, such as jokers based on Homestuck characters and Aspects, a new enhancement (as well as a spectral card to apply it, a hand that utilizes the enhancement, and a planet card to go with the hand), and even stickers based on each of the Aspects (as well as a tarot card to apply them).
This mod may cause compatibility issues with other mods that take ownership of base game spectral and tarot cards. Please let me know if this occurs, so I may be able to get in contact with the developer(s) of the other mods to figure out a solution.
